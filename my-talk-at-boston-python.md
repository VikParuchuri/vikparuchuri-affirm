I just gave a talk at [Boston Python](http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/107649802/) about natural language processing in general, and [edX ease](https://github.com/edx/ease) and [discern](https://github.com/edx/discern) in specific.

You can find the presentation source [here](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/boston-python-ml), and the web version of it [here](http://vikparuchuri.github.io/boston-python-ml).

There is a video of it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSC1-XzyfJU#t=1h24m40s).

[Nelle Varoquaux](https://twitter.com/nvaroqua) and [Michael Selik](https://twitter.com/MikeSelik) also had interesting talks in the same video above, recommend checking them out.
